Randomly generated solar systems in Three.js

This is my first project with Three.js. I have learned the fundamentals of the library: Scene, Renderer, Camera, Geometry, Material, Mesh, Texture... I have also understood how to use OrbitControls and make a Skybox.

See the [live demo](https://solar.sabu.fr).

## Local development
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Making a Skybox
| C  | U  | B  | E  |
|----|----|----|----|
|    | pY |    |    |
| pX | nZ | nX | pZ |
|    | nY |    |    |

Three.js loads the textures in the following order: pX, nX, pY, nY, pZ, nZ.

pY and nY need to be rotated 180ยบ.
